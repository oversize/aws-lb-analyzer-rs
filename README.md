# Aws Load Balancer Logs Analyzer

I needed to investigate the log files of an aws loadbalancer. In particular
i wanted to have the top 50 IP addresses. Ulitmatly i want to have something
similar to  what https://vegalog.net/ provides, only that its running locally,
and written in rust.

I'm fairly new to Rust so happy to receive any Feedback you might have
on how to improve the code.
